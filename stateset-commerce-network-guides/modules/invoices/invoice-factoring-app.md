# Invoice Factoring App

How it works Fixed Price NFTs (Invoices, Agreements, Purchase Orders) are minted with a specific STATE amount on the Stateset Network. This represents a tokenized RWA like a receivable with an associated DID (linked to the parties and legal electronic document&#x20;

The Seller sends an Invoice to the Purchaser with an Amount 1 STATE <-> 1 USDC If a Factor decides to Factor the Invoice, the Amount - Fee in STATE is sent to the seller. When the Purchaser pays the Invoice it sends the amount in STATE to the Factor.&#x20;

If there is no Factor assigned to the invoice, when the Purchaser clicks Pay it debits the Amount from their Stateset wallet and sends it to the Seller.&#x20;

Direct, Collateralized Loans Can also be made between borrowers and lenders on the network.

The Collateral is placed into escrow with a fee and deadline for repayment created by the Borrower. If the Lender Approves the Loan, the Amount of STATE is sent directly to the borrower. If the Loan is not repaid by the deadline, the Lender can liquidate the collateral. The Stateset smart contracts gives vendor(s)/seller(s) the ability to sell their invoices at a predetermined price and discount rate. The lender(s)/buyer(s) are buying a put option on an account receivable for a 2.60% fee with a 30, 60 or 90 day expiration. They are providing a 90% advance and this opens up DeFi to every small business who is earning .02pct on their bank account deposits and has to wait days or weeks to borrow against their own money. So you would take the $10,000 you have in your Signature Bank Account and convert that to USDC or STATE via Stateset's Ramp integration. It then would be sent to the Stateset Blockchain via IBC. You now have 10,000 USDC in your Stateset account. That will be there for 12 days, offer it as liquidity for that period to factor an invoice or loan it to a borrower to make more than a few percent for that period, and if you can keep it longer, you can borrow against it to pay your bills.
