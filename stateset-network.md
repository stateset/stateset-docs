# Stateset Network

Stateset Commerce Network is a proof-of-stake blockchain network built with the Cosmos-SDK. The Stateset Commerce Network is powered by the latest innovations in the web3 / decentralized finance ecosystem. Smart Contracts can be deployed to the Stateset Commerce Network using CosmWasm.

Abstract from the Stateset Whitepaper:

> A purely peer-to-peer network for computational contracts and real-time transactions with low fees, instant finality and minimal trust between nodes would allow for the creation of a globally distributed open commerce platform. We present the Stateset Commerce Network, a permissionless, sovereign blockchain network, and describe in detail how it achieves the goal of a state-of-the-art, collaborative financial system for global commerce. Stateset is built on a new set of fundamental technological advancements; Bitcoin \[1], the Cosmos-SDK \[2], Tendermint BFT Consensus Engine \[3], CosmWasm \[5] smart contract framework and IBC \[6] for transport, authorization and ordering of packets with other blockchain networks. This creates an open, global, community structured, backend system for sustainable computational commerce.
